# FishFreshnessDetection

*Background*: Ensuring fish freshness is crucial to maintain quality and safety throughout the seafood supply chain. Fish freshness is a critical factor in the seafood industry as it directly impacts quality, consumer satisfaction, and safety. The various ways to determine fish's freshness range from sensory evaluation by trained experts to instrumental methods including chemical analysis, texture analysis, and microbial testing. With the advent of quick, non-destructive techniques like biosensors and electronic noses, technology has made it possible to assess the freshness of fish in real time and objectively. Traditional sensory evaluation methods are subjective in nature and can be time-consuming, requiring trained panelists to physically examine and assess each sample individually.

*Objective*: The objective of our research paper is to evaluate the efficacy of different CNN models, namely VGG-19, MobileNetV2, DenseNet201, and ResNet50, for classifying fish freshness using our carefully curated dataset of fresh and non-fresh fish species.

*Methods*: A comprehensive dataset comprising fresh and unfresh fish species was curated. Subsequently, four CNN models, namely VGG-19, MobileNetV2, ResNet50, and DenseNet201, underwent training and testing employing our dataset. The models' performance was evaluated, and a detailed analysis of their classification accuracy in determining fish freshness was conducted.

*Results*: Our results indicate that the CNN models, particularly DenseNet201 and MobileNetv2, achieved high accuracy in classifying fish freshness on our dataset. The results demonstrated that the quality and diversity of our dataset played a crucial role in improving the models' performance, with DenseNet201 demonstrating the highest accuracy among the models evaluated.

*Conclusion*: The research demonstrates the significance of dataset quality and diversity in training CNN models for fish freshness classification. The results highlight the adaptability of DenseNet201 and MobileNetv2 for this task and emphasize the importance of carefully curated datasets in achieving accurate classification of fish freshness. These findings contribute to the understanding of model performance and dataset quality in the context of fish freshness classification.
